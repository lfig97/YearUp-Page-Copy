If you have the means to give, Year Up has set up a COVID-19 Impact Fund to support costs incurred in our transition to virtual program delivery as well as to address the increased risk to our fundraising and corporate engagement revenue sources given the economic impact of this crisis. During this turbulent time, your generosity makes a huge difference.
