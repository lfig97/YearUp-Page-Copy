                    <p>Year Up is committed to ensuring equitable access to economic opportunity, education, and justice for all young adults—no matter their background, income, or zip code. Employers face a growing need for talent while millions are left disconnected from the economic mainstream. These inequities only further
                        perpetuate the Opportunity Divide that exists in our country—a divide that Year Up
                        is determined and positioned to close.</p>

        <h2>HISTORY</h2>
            <p>
                Gerald Chertavian was a successful technology entrepreneur and Wall Street banker, 
                but it was through his many years as a Big Brother that he found his true calling. 
                The young adults he met had immense talent; yet all too often they were stranded outside
                the economic mainstream. Chertavian saw that when given a fair chance, with challenging 
                standards and high support, these young people could accomplish anything. 
                In 2000, he dedicated his life and business expertise to closing the "Opportunity Divide," 
                and Year Up was born.
